# oc.memcached

This Docker image is built upon an existing Memcached base image, ensuring compatibility and leveraging its established functionality while introducing
seamless updates. The update process is designed to maintain the original behavior of the application without altering any core logic, configurations, or
user interactions. By extending the base image through layered modifications—such as patching specific components or integrating enhanced features—the new
version retains full backward compatibility, allowing deployments to proceed without disruption. This approach ensures that users benefit from improved
performance, security patches, or additional capabilities while preserving the reliability and predictability of the Memcached service.
